# matlab-Viola-and-Jones-Implementation

A test with Viola And Jones I did for the Robotic Masters. It is a big buggy and takes ages to learn, and it can be likely improved.
Done between 2015 and 2016.

This project has quite a story behind it and became a big part of my daily routine during 2 semesters in the Robotic Master. 

This project kinda sorta mark the way I went to the Robotic Master. Also it was done in a time in where I had to work full shift every day - 8 hours daily - and after that getting a 1.30h train travel to go to the university and study. Also in that time my job started to not to want to pay its workers. So considering all the things I had to live throught, I am a bit proud of it.

* I was asked to do this boosting algorithm using the Viola and Jones in one week (with other projects and exams around)
* We were supposed to be 2 people, but my companion did not even read the paper and gave up before even starting
* I must point out that in the master people weren't from a programming environment, I was an exception
* I didn't manage to do a viable prototype in a week by myself, It took me that time to understand 80% of the paper xP
* I asked for one month to do a viable prototype and I was granted. I managed to finish it, yet it was buggy.
* after I gave the project to the teacher, he told me that the learning data set was too small and I needed way more. The only problem was that it took a whole 5 hours to "learn". And I didn't had tools to debug any possible errors in the implementation.
* the teacher agreed with me that the project objectives were far beyond his subject (intro to computer vision).
* a year after that another teacher learned I had this project and insisted that I should finish it so we can put it in a IOT camera. It took me all the semester, combining it with other projects and subjects to really make tools to debug the learning process.
* the teacher totally ignored me when I told him I was not going to be not able to do it on time.
* the day before of the presentation I managed to do a viable prototype with a lot of self created tools that let me to do a bit of research. However I was not on time to do a presentation
* for some reason, the teacher came to the presentation late, and he was moody and took out on me in that presentation. So much that another teacher sided with me. That was the day I decided to quit the master and focus in having more stability in my life.

I know its not perfect
I know it can be improved
I really hated to have to work in this project with such time restraings and whitout any free time
However I did love the challenge and all what I learn about learning algorithms and matlab.

I always wanted to share it for if someone wanted to take a look. I am open to suggestions to improve it :)
